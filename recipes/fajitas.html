    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <h3>Marinade:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicekn breasts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Vegetables:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make marinade: Combine olive oil, lime juice, chili powder, 
            cumin, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Add chicken 
            and toss until well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate, 
            4 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken to the 
            hot skillet, reserving marinade. Cook until no longer pink in the 
            center and the juices run clear, 6 to 8 minutes per side. An instant-read 
            thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F 
            (74 degrees C). Remove chicken from the skillet, slice, and set aside.        </li>
        <li>Cook vegetables: Heat olive oil in the same skillet. Add onion, 
            bell peppers, and reserved marinade. Cook and stir until vegetables 
            are soft and tender, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add chicken back to the skillet; 
            cook and stir until warmed through, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
