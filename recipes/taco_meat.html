    <h2>Description</h2>
    
    <p>Your ground turkey tacos will have amazing flavor and fewer calories because of the ground turkey! It is a little spicy, but our family enjoys it this way. Because it has so much flavor, you cannot even tell it's not ground beef. It tastes great in tacos or as a topping for baked potatoes.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>1.5 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces ground turkey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cider vinegar</li>

        <li>Combine chili powder, cumin, paprika, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, oregano, and cayenne in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add ground turkey and cook, stirring to break up clumps, until no longer pink, about 5 minutes. Stir in spice mixture and water. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed, about 10 minutes.</li>
